Before heading into what LaTeX is.Lets first describe why LaTeX for documentation and this  guide does not require us to have any prior knowledge of LaTeX, but by the time we are finished, we will have written our first LaTeX document, and hopefully will have a good knowledge of some of the basic functions provided by LaTeX and use  it for our next coming project's documnetations.

## Why LaTeX?

> LATEX is used all over the world for scientific documents, books, as well as many other forms of publishing.

and more points for answer WHY:

* Quickly tackle the more complicated parts of typesetting, such as inputting mathematics, creating tables of contents, referencing and creating bibliographies, 
* Huge number of open source packages available in LaTeX has added the golden lining to do even more with LATEX, such as add footnotes, draw schematics, create tables etc

> Most important reason people are using LaTeX is that, it separates the content of the document from the style.

Once we have written the content of out document, we can change its appearance with ease in just few style of LaTeX and also allows scientific journals to create templates for submissions in ease.
